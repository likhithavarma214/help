# DAST Authenticated Scan

AccuKnox Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) supports **authenticated scans**, enabling the crawler to access and test content behind login pages. The system visualises the session state with **Logged In**, **Logged Out**, and **Fallback** indicators — preventing false negatives where crawlers fail to reach protected content.

!!! tip "Unauthenticated scans"
    If you only need to scan publicly accessible pages without supplying credentials, see [DAST Unauthenticated Scan](dast-scan-no-auth.md).
