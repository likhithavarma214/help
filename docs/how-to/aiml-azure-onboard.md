**Step 1:** Go to your Azure Portal and search for *App registrations* and open it

Create a custom role with the following actions:
`Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/onlineEndpoints/score/action`
`Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/serverlessEndpoints/listKeys/action`
`Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/listKeys/action`
`Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/batchEndpoints/score/action`

It will look similar to this (use the above listed permissions):
