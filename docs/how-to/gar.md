# Google Artifact Registry (GAR) Onboarding

When [Google Artifact Registry](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs) with images is onboarded into AccuKnox SaaS platform, the images are scanned continuously. The risks and vulnerabilities associated with these images are identified and shown in the scan results. The vulnerabilities are classified based on the CVSS Scores.

## Steps to create service account in GCP for onboarding GAR

**Step 1**: Open the GCP Management Console and sign in with your GCP account credentials. Select the Project in which the GAR registry to be scanned is located
