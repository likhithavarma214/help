# CWPP Report Generation

**Understand the Regex to Select the Cluster Name and Namespace**

The CWPP report generation utilizes regular expressions (regex) to specify and filter cluster names and namespaces. The syntax for regex follows a particular pattern to ensure accurate selection.

## Regex

**Regex Syntax Format**: Cluster Name Selection / Namespace Selection

### Rules for Regular Expression

**Excluding**

- To exclude a specific cluster or namespace, prefix it with a hyphen (-).

!!! info "NOTE"
    To exclude any cluster or namespace, it must be included in the selection first.

**Select all**

- Use an asterisk (*) to select all clusters or namespaces.

**Delimiter**

- A forward slash (/) is used to delimit the cluster name selection from the namespace selection.

### Examples

- `cluster1/ns1`: Include only namespace ns1 from cluster cluster1.
- `cluster1/*`: Include all namespaces from cluster cluster1.
- `cluster1/ns*`: Include namespaces starting with ns from cluster cluster1.
- `-cluster1/ns3`: Exclude namespace ns3 from cluster cluster1.
- `*/ns1`: Include namespace ns1 from all clusters.
- `*/*`: Include all namespaces from all clusters.

## Reports Configuration

Reports can be configured in two ways: On Demand and Scheduled.
