# AccuKnox Enterprise Architecture

AccuKnox's Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform (CNAPP) offers a unified **AppSec + CloudSec** solution, integrating modules like ASPM, CSPM, CWPP, KIEM, and GRC. This architecture ensures comprehensive security across the software development lifecycle.

## Core Components

### Control Plane

![](./images/deep-arch/control-plane-arch.png)

**Key Components**

1. Playbook job scheduling: Microservices (Divy), Kueue scheduler, Celery tasks
2. Parser jobs for asset + findings database
3. Alerts and telemetry handling via RabbitMQ
4. SPIFFE-based secure cluster onboarding
5. Storage layer: RDS, MongoDB, Neo4j
6. External integrations & triggers handling

## Cloud Architecture

![](./images/deep-arch/cloud-arch.png)

- SaaS and On-Prem support identical services (except AskADA AI Copilot – SaaS only)
- Tenant-level feature control
- Models:
      1. SaaS: AWS-managed (Aurora, S3)
      2. On-Prem: Full in-cluster setup (for air-gapped environments)
      3. Externalized: Uses customer DB/storage

## Externalized Storage Architecture

![](./images/deep-arch/externalized-storage.png)

- Supports deployments with customer-managed storage
- Enables hybrid cloud use cases
- Flexible DB integration (e.g., existing RDS, MongoDB, etc.)

## On-Premises Deployment Architecture

![](./images/deep-arch/onprem-arch.png)

- K8s-native deployment
- No reliance on AWS managed services
- Designed for high-security & compliance environments

## Scaling & High Availability

![](./images/deep-arch/scan-alert-flow.png)

AccuKnox scales horizontally using native Kubernetes constructs — new nodes are added dynamically based on CPU, memory, and queue-depth thresholds. Most services are stateless, meaning any instance can serve any request and pods can be restarted without data loss.

**Noisy Neighbor Isolation**

- Per-tenant Kubernetes namespaces with resource quotas prevent a single tenant from consuming disproportionate resources
- [Kueue](https://kueue.sigs.k8s.io/) provides fair scheduling for batch workloads (playbooks, scans, parsing) across tenants
- RabbitMQ telemetry overload is managed via thresholds with offload to SIEM

**High Availability**

The AccuKnox control plane is deployed across multiple Availability Zones (AZs):

- Kubernetes control plane nodes are spread across AZs (odd-number quorum for etcd)
- Stateful services (databases, object storage, message bus) use multi-AZ replication
- Pod anti-affinity rules and topology spread constraints prevent co-location failures
- In case of an AZ failure, ingress shifts traffic automatically and pods are rescheduled in remaining AZs

## Log & Data Storage

- **RDS**: CSPM, KSPM, ASPM (per-tenant tables)
- **MongoDB**: Telemetry logs (per-tenant collections)
- **Neo4j**: GraphDB for metadata (KIEM), expanding to assets/findings in v3.0

## Customer Data Flow

![](./images/deep-arch/customer-data-flow.png)

Asset and findings data flows from customer environments to the AccuKnox control plane via token-authenticated APIs. Playbooks execute in the control plane (or customer environment for CDR), generate reports, and store results in S3 — where Celery tasks parse and update RDS, MongoDB, and Neo4j. The UI fetches all data via AccuKnox APIs. All data in transit is encrypted; no direct DB access is exposed externally.

## Rules Engine Architecture

![](./images/deep-arch/rules-engine-arch.png)

- Parser emits events → Rules Engine evaluates
- Tenant-specific rule specs evaluated
- Actions (e.g., notifications, tickets) sent as Celery tasks
- Fully asynchronous, scalable via queues


## Integrations Architecture

![](./images/deep-arch/integrations.png)

- **CLI-based**: TruffleHog, Sonarqube, Trivy, Zap, Kubebench
- **API-based**: Checkmarx, Nessus
- **SIEM**: One-way push (e.g., Splunk, Sentinel)
- **Ticketing**: Bidirectional (e.g., Jira, ServiceNow)

**Integration Timelines**

- CLI-based: 1 sprint
- API-based: 2–3 weeks
- SIEM: 1 sprint
- Ticketing: 3–5 sprints

## Compliance Frameworks

![Compliance Frameworks](/getting-started/images/accuknox-arch/7.png)

Supports over 30 regulatory standards, including:

- **General**: ISO 27001, PCI DSS, SOC2.
- **Industry-Specific**: HIPAA, GDPR.

## SLA Commitments

| Objective | Commitment |
|---|---|
| **RTO** (Recovery Time Objective) | 6 hours — core platform restored after a major incident |
| **RPO** (Recovery Point Objective) | 24 hours — maximum data loss in a catastrophic failure scenario |

> Runtime enforcement on customer clusters continues to operate independently during any control plane recovery.
