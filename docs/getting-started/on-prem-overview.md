## High-Level Architecture Overview

![](./images/on-prem/3.png)

AccuKnox onprem deployment is based on Kubernetes native architecture.

## AccuKnox OnPrem k8s components

=== "Microservices"

  * Golang microservices handle streaming data (alerts, telemetry).
  * Python microservices manage control-plane services.

=== "Databases"

  * PostgreSQL stores relational data.
  * MongoDB stores JSON events (alerts, telemetry).
  * Ceph stores scanned reports, managed by Rook operator.

=== "Secrets Management"

  * Vault stores internal and user secrets.
  * Service accounts and tokens manage authorization.

=== "Scaling"

  * Horizontal and vertical pod autoscaling enabled for most microservices.
  * Resource limits are set for scaling.

=== "AccuKnox-Agents"

  * Agents run in k8s clusters and VMs for runtime security and forensics.
  * Use eBPF and LSMs for telemetry and attack prevention.
  * SPIFFE/SPIRE handles attestation and certificate rotation.

## Onboarding Steps for AccuKnox

The onboarding process for AccuKnox's on-prem security solution consists of four concise steps:
