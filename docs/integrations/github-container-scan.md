# Setting Up Container Scanning in GitHub CI/CD Pipeline

In this guide, we demonstrate how to incorporate AccuKnox's container scanning capabilities into a GitHub Actions workflow. The process ensures that vulnerabilities in Docker images are identified and remediated before deployment, significantly improving the security posture of your CI/CD pipeline.

## **Scenario Before Integration**

- **Context**: The Docker image was built using an outdated base image (`node:15-slim`) with known vulnerabilities, introducing security risks into the deployment pipeline.

- **Issues**:

    - Vulnerabilities in the base image were not detected.

    - The image was pushed to the registry without any security validation.

## **Steps for Integrating AccuKnox**

### **Step 1: Generate AccuKnox Token**

Log in to AccuKnox. Navigate to **Settings → Tokens** to create an AccuKnox token for forwarding scan results to SaaS. For details on generating tokens, refer to [How to Create Tokens](https://help.accuknox.com/how-to/how-to-create-tokens/?h=token "https://help.accuknox.com/how-to/how-to-create-tokens/?h=token").

### **Step 2: Configure GitHub Secrets**

Store the following values as GitHub repository secrets:

- `ACCUKNOX_TOKEN`: AccuKnox API token.

- `ACCUKNOX_LABEL`: Custom label for associating scan results.

- `ACCUKNOX_ENDPOINT`: (Optional) AccuKnox API URL (default: `cspm.demo.accuknox.com`).

### **Step 3: Set Up GitHub Actions Workflow**

Create a workflow YAML file in your repository `.github/workflows/accuknox-scan.yml`:

{% raw %}
```yaml
name: AccuKnox Container Scan Workflow

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  accuknox-cicd:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Run AccuKnox CSPM Scan
        uses: accuknox/container-scan-action@v1.0.1
        with:
          soft_fail: false
          accuknox_endpoint: ${{ secrets.ACCUKNOX_ENDPOINT }}
          accuknox_label: ${{ secrets.ACCUKNOX_LABEL }}
          accuknox_token: ${{ secrets.ACCUKNOX_TOKEN }}
          image: "your-image-name"
          tag: "latest"
          severity: "LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL, UNKNOWN"
```
{% endraw %}
