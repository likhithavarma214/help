## Jira Assignee Support

Users can now add Jira ticket Assignee as well when they create the ticket for any particular vulnerability or misconfiguration from the AccuKnox SaaS itself. To do this the users must follow the following steps:

**Step 1:** Users first need to integrate their jira cloud using the instructions [here ](https://help.accuknox.com/integrations/jira-cloud/#integration-of-jira)

**Step 2:** After the integration the Users need to create the Configuration for the integration. For this users need to select the Integration->CSPM->jira Integration-> Add configuration

![jira-cloud-integration-accuknox](./images/jira-cloud/1.png)

**Step 3:** Now when the users select the project name in the Ticket configuration the assignee users will be listed. The users can select any name and save the ticket configuration after filling all other necessary fields. 

![jira-cloud-integration-accuknox](./images/jira-cloud/2.png)

From now on the users can create the ticket with this particular configuration so that the ticket will be created with the assignee set to the name that  was selected during the configuration.

If the users want to change the assignee during the ticket creation that can also be done by clicking on the assignee section as shown below

![jira-cloud-integration-accuknox](./images/jira-cloud/3.png)

!!! info "NOTE"
    If the user wants to set the tickets for multiple people then they will have to create multiple ticket configurations. Each configuration can be assigned to only one Assignee.
