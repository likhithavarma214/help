# Gitlab Secret Scan

This guide walks you through integrating AccuKnox Secret Scanning into your GitLab CI/CD pipeline to improve code security. The integration helps identify hard-coded secrets and sensitive data in your repositories, with scan results uploaded to the AccuKnox SaaS platform for analysis and remediation.

## Pre-requisites

- GitLab Access

- AccuKnox Platform Access

## Steps for Integration

**Step 1**: Log in to AccuKnox. Navigate to **Settings → Tokens** to create an AccuKnox token for forwarding scan results to SaaS. For details on generating tokens, refer to [How to Create Tokens](https://help.accuknox.com/how-to/how-to-create-tokens/?h=token "https://help.accuknox.com/how-to/how-to-create-tokens/?h=token").

**Step 2:** Configure GitLab CI/CD Variables. For details on configuring variables, refer to [How to Create CI/CD Variables in GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/ "https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/").

1.  **ACCUKNOX_TOKEN**: AccuKnox API token for authorization.

2.  **ACCUKNOX_TENANT**: Your AccuKnox tenant ID.

3.  **ACCUKNOX_ENDPOINT**: The AccuKnox API URL (e.g., [cspm.demo.accuknox.com](http://cspm.demo.accuknox.com/ "http://cspm.demo.accuknox.com/")).

4.  **ACCUKNOX_LABEL**: The label for your scan.

**Step 3**: Set Up GitLab CI/CD Pipeline

| Input Value          | Description                                                                 | Default Value            |
| :------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------- |
| `STAGE`              | Specifies the pipeline stage.                                               | `test`                   |
| `RESULTS`            | Specifies which type(s) of results to output: `verified`, `unknown`, `unverified`, `filtered_unverified`. Defaults to all types. | `""`                     |
| `BRANCH`             | The branch to scan. Use `all-branches` to scan all branches.                | `""`                     |
| `EXCLUDE_PATHS`      | Paths to exclude from the scan.                                             | `""`                     |
| `ADDITIONAL_ARGUMENTS` | Extra parameters for secret scanning.                                       | `""`                     |
| `SOFT_FAIL`          | Do not return an error code if secrets are found.                           | `true`                   |
| `ACCUKNOX_TOKEN`     | The token for authenticating with the CSPM panel.                           | `N/A (Required)`         |
| `ACCUKNOX_TENANT`    | The ID of the tenant associated with the CSPM panel.                        | `N/A (Required)`         |
| `ACCUKNOX_ENDPOINT`  | The URL of the CSPM panel to push the scan results to.                      | `cspm.demo.accuknox.com` |
| `ACCUKNOX_LABEL`     | The label created in AccuKnox SaaS for associating scan results.            | `N/A (Required)`         |

Create a new pipeline in your GitLab project with the following YAML configuration:

```yaml
include:
  - component: $CI_SERVER_FQDN/accu-knox/scan/secret-scan@main
    inputs:
      STAGE: test
      INPUT_SOFT_FAIL: false
      ACCUKNOX_TOKEN: ${ACCUKNOX_TOKEN}
      ACCUKNOX_TENANT: ${ACCUKNOX_TENANT}
      ACCUKNOX_ENDPOINT: ${ACCUKNOX_ENDPOINT}
      ACCUKNOX_LABEL: ${ACCUKNOX_LABEL}
```

## Impact of AccuKnox Secret Scanning Integration

### Before Integration

Your pipeline might not perform secret scanning, potentially exposing sensitive data in your code.

### After Integration

AccuKnox Secret Scanning will run on every push, detecting hard-coded secrets and sensitive information. The findings are sent to AccuKnox for review and remediation. Only the scan results are uploaded, not the sensitive data.

## View Results in AccuKnox SaaS

**Step 1**: Navigate to the AccuKnox SaaS dashboard after the pipeline completes.

**Step 2**: Go to **Issues** > **Findings** and select **Secret Scan Findings** to see identified vulnerabilities.

### Step 3: Review Detected Secrets

Examine the list of identified hardcoded secrets and sensitive information.

### Step 4: Address Findings

For each finding, create a task in your issue-tracking system, advising secret rotation and the use of a secure secret management solution. Once resolved, mark the issue as fixed in the AccuKnox platform.
