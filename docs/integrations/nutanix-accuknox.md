# Nutanix Installation with KubeArmor

AccuKnox runtime security for Kubernetes aids in discovering the application behavior of your workload and offers the capability to enforce security policies. AccuKnox automatically detects and suggests Behavioral Policies based on application observability, such as file system access for processes and processes that are accessing the network.

AccuKnox leverages KubeArmor to implement runtime security policies, utilizing eBPF and LSMs (SELinux, BPF LSM, AppArmor). LSMs serve as a checkpoint based on the applied policies, scrutinizing all events and system calls against these policies before they interact with kernel objects. KubeArmor ensures that any event not compliant with the policies is prevented from executing in the userspace, thus maintaining a secure environment for your applications to operate.

AccuKnox offers the subsequent enterprise functionalities to enhance runtime security:

- Auto-Discovered Behavioural Policies
- Recommendation of Hardening Policies based on compliance framework - MITRE, NIST, PCI-DSS, CIS
- Inventory View of Application
- Network Graph View of the Application
- Network micro-segmentation in the application
- Hardening of the Secrets Managers like Hashicorp Vault, CyberArk Conjur
- GitOps-based Version Control for Policy Lifecycle Management
- Rollback of recently changed Policy governing App Behavior
- On-the-fly detection of change in App Behavior through Policies
- Multi-tenant, Multi-Cluster, RBAC for user management
- Comprehensive Dashboard across workloads running in Managed/Unmanaged Cluster, Containerized environment, VM or Baremetal
- Integration with Registries for Container Image Vuln Scan
- Telemetry aggregation (Process executed, File accessed, Network connections made) and Alerts events (Audit, Block)
- Integration to SIEM for security events and Notification tool

The utilization of the following AccuKnox agents assists in delivering the enterprise features:

**Agents operator**: It will detect the environment of the k8s that is installed and based on that, it will pull all the AccuKnox Agents for Installation.

**Discovery Engine**: AccuKnox Discovery Engine leverages the pod visibility provided by KubeArmor to automatically generate System and Network Policies.

**Feeder Service**: The feeder service sends information from the Client Cluster to the AccuKnox SaaS Control Plane. Feeder Service is an agent that runs on every node, collects telemetry/alert events from source systems and messages, and emits them to the Messaging Cluster for Storage and Analysis.

**Policy Enforcement Agent**: AccuKnox’s Policy Enforcement Agent enforces the policies by leveraging KubeArmor. The policy not only keeps track of the policies but is capable of doing tasks such as applying policies, denying policies, updating policies, and deleting the policies.

**Shared Informer Agent**: Shared Informer Agent watches all the changes occurring in Kubernetes entities such as Pods, Nodes, Namespaces, Endpoints, and Services.

## **Before you Begin**

This procedure requires the following items and configurations:

- A fully configured and running Amazon EKS cluster with administrative privileges.

- The current version of DKP Enterprise is <a href="https://docs.d2iq.com/dkp/2.7/kommander-installations-by-environment" target="_blank">installed</a> on your cluster.

- Ensure you have installed ```kubectl``` in your Management cluster.

In this case, we will be using D2iQ managed cluster created from the D2iQ console, You can use user attached cluster as well

### **CWPP Dashboard**

The AccuKnox CWPP Dashboard offers a comprehensive overview of runtime protection for clusters through various informative widgets. These widgets include:

- **Alerts Summary**: Provides a summarized count of alerts generated in the cluster or a specific namespace. Details include total alerts, blocked alerts (from system block policies), and audited alerts (from audit policies).

- **Compliance Summary**: Displays the compliance benchmarks applied to the cluster/namespace through KubeArmor's hardening policies. Presents information about MITRE, NIST, CIS, PCI-DSS benchmarks.

- **Compliance Alerts**: Graphically represents compliance alerts generated in the cluster/namespace, using distinct color coding for various compliance benchmarks like MITRE, NIST, PCI-DSS, etc.

- **Namespace Severity**: Offers a summary of attack severity attempted in the different namespaces within the cluster.

- **Top 10 Policies by Alerts Count**: Presents a graphical representation of the top 10 policies for which alerts are generated in the cluster/namespace. Useful for identifying high-alert generating policies.

- **Namespace Alerts**: Displays alerts specific to the selected namespace within the cluster, providing detailed information about the alerts.

- **Pod Alerts**: Offers insights into alerts originating from the pods running within the cluster/namespace.

- **Alert-based Operations**: Graphically represents alert-triggering operations such as file access, process blocks, and audits, giving users an overview of the types of alerts generated.

- **Alerts based on Severity**: Provides information on attack severity levels that were mitigated by the runtime protection policies within the chosen cluster/namespace.
