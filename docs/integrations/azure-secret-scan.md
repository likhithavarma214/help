#### Step 2: Generate an AccuKnox API Token

1.  Log in to the AccuKnox platform.

2.  Go to **Settings** > **Tokens** and create a new token.

3.  Copy the token and save it for later use. For guidance on creating tokens, refer to [Creating Tokens in AccuKnox](https://help.accuknox.com/how-to/how-to-create-tokens/ "https://help.accuknox.com/how-to/how-to-create-tokens/").

#### Step 3: Set Up Variables in Azure DevOps

1.  Navigate to your Azure DevOps project.

2.  Go to **Project Settings** > **Pipelines** > **Library** and click **+ Variable Group**.

3.  Add the following variables:

| **Variable**          | **Description**                                                                                                                  | **Default Value**  |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `results`             | Specifies which type(s) of results to output: `verified`, `unknown`, `unverified`, `filtered_unverified`. Defaults to all types. | `""`               |
| `branch`              | The branch to scan. Use `all-branches` to scan all branches.                                                                     | `""`               |
| `excludePaths`        | Paths to exclude from the scan.                                                                                                  | `""`               |
| `additionalArguments` | Extra parameters for secret scanning.                                                                                            | `""`               |
| `inputSoftFail`       | Do not return an error code if secrets are found.                                                                                | `true`             |
| `ACCUKNOX_TOKEN`       | The token for authenticating with the CSPM panel.                                                                                | **N/A (Required)** |
| `ACCUKNOX_ENDPOINT`    | The URL of the CSPM panel to push the scan results to.                                                                           | **N/A (Required)** |

#### Step 4: Configure Pipeline to Run Secret Scanning

1.  Open or create your pipeline's YAML file in Azure DevOps.

2.  Add the following task to your pipeline's `steps` section:

```yaml
trigger:
- azure-pipelines.yml


pool:
  name: Default
  demands:
    - Agent.Name -equals HPV

steps:
- checkout: self
steps:-
- checkout: self
- task: accuknox-secret-scan@2
  inputs:
    accuknoxEndpoint: '$(ACCUKNOX_ENDPOINT)'
    accuknoxToken: '$(ACCUKNOX_TOKEN)'
    accuknoxLabel: '$(ACCUKNOX_LABEL)'
    inputSoftFail: true

```

#### Step 5: Trigger the Pipeline

- Manually trigger the pipeline or push a code change to initiate the scanning process.

- Monitor the pipeline logs to ensure the AccuKnox Secret Scanning task executes successfully.
