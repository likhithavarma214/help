# Container Image Scan with Azure DevOps

This guide walks you through integrating **AccuKnox** into **Azure DevOps pipelines** to perform vulnerability scans on Docker images as part of your CI workflow. By embedding security earlier in the development lifecycle, this setup helps prevent the deployment of flawed containers.

### Prerequisites

Before beginning, ensure the following:

- **Azure DevOps** project with a configured pipeline.

- Access to **AccuKnox**

### Integration Steps

#### Step 1: Install AccuKnox Opengrep SAST Extension

1. Visit the **Azure DevOps Marketplace**

2. Search for [**AccuKnox Container Scan**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AccuKnox.accuknox-container-scan "https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AccuKnox.accuknox-container-scan") and select **Get it free** to add to your Azure DevOps organization.

#### Step 2: Generate AccuKnox API Token

Log in to AccuKnox. Navigate to **Settings → Tokens** to create an AccuKnox token to forward scan results to AccuKnox. For details on generating tokens, refer to [How to Create Tokens](https://help.accuknox.com/how-to/how-to-create-tokens/?h=token "https://help.accuknox.com/how-to/how-to-create-tokens/?h=token").

#### Step 3: Configure Azure DevOps Secrets

1.  Go to **Azure DevOps** > **Pipelines** > **Library**.

2.  Create a **Variable Group** or add **Pipeline Secrets**.

3.  Store the following values:

| **Name**           | **Description**                                                                        |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `accuknoxEndpoint` | The URL of the CSPM panel to push the scan results to (e.g., `cspm.demo.accuknox.com`) |
| `accuknoxToken`    | Token for authenticating with the AccuKnox CSPM panel                                  |
| `accuknoxLabel`    | Label to categorize or tag the scan results                                            |

The label used to categorize and identify scan results in AccuKnox. [Create a new label](https://help.accuknox.com/how-to/how-to-create-labels/ "https://help.accuknox.com/how-to/how-to-create-labels/") if it is not available

#### Step 4: Define Azure DevOps Pipeline

In your Azure repo, create/update your pipeline YAML (`azure-pipelines.yml`) and add the following task to your pipeline's steps section:

```yaml
trigger:
- azure-pipelines.yml


pool:
  name: Default
  demands:
    - Agent.Name -equals HPV
steps:
  - checkout: self  
  - task: AccuKnox-Container-Scan@2
  inputs:
    imageName: 'nginx'
    tag: 'latest'
    accuknoxEndpoint: '$(ACCUKNOX_ENDPOINT)'
    accuknoxToken: '$(ACCUKNOX_TOKEN))'
    accuknoxLabel: '$(ACCUKNOX_LABEL))'
    inputSoftFail: true

```

### After AccuKnox Integration

**Workflow Enhancements:**

- Docker images are automatically scanned for vulnerabilities during the build stage.

- The pipeline fails if critical issues are found, preventing insecure images from being deployed.

**Outcome:**

- Security issues are detected and resolved early, before images reach production.

- Only verified, secure images are pushed to the container registry.

## Viewing Scan Results in AccuKnox

---

**Step 1:** After the pipeline is complete, log in to the **AccuKnox platform** and navigate to **Issues → RegistryScan**. Locate your image by the repository or tag used in the Azure DevOps pipeline, and click to view associated scan findings.

![image-20250530-062251.png](./images/azure-container-scan/5.png)

**Step 2:** Selecting the image will display detailed **metadata**, including image name, tag, build time, and source repository information, all linked to the pipeline execution in Azure DevOps.

![image-20250530-062319.png](./images/azure-container-scan/6.png)

**Step 3:** In the **Vulnerabilities** section, you'll find a list of identified issues specific to the scanned image. Each item includes severity, package name, version, and remediation details. These are also accessible under **Issues → Vulnerabilities** for cross-image management.

![image-20250530-062357.png](./images/azure-container-scan/7.png)

**Step 4:** The **Resources** section outlines the underlying **packages and modules** that were used to build the Docker image---helpful for dependency tracking and vulnerability source analysis.

![image-20250530-062422.png](./images/azure-container-scan/8.png)

**Step 5:** You can explore the **Scan History** tab to track scans over time, observe vulnerability trends, and verify improvements from one pipeline execution to the next.

## Conclusion

---

By integrating AccuKnox into your **Azure DevOps pipeline**, you gain continuous visibility into container vulnerabilities. This integration ensures that only thoroughly scanned and secure Docker images are deployed, reinforcing your production security posture and reducing attack surface.
