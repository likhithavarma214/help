title: Integrating DAST with AccuKnox in a GitHub CI/CD Pipeline
description: Learn how to integrate Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) with AccuKnox in a GitHub CI/CD pipeline.
---

To demonstrate the benefits of incorporating AccuKnox into a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to enhance security, consider a specific scenario involving a domain with known vulnerabilities. By integrating AccuKnox scanning into the pipeline, we can identify and resolve these security issues.

## Prerequisites

- GitHub repository access.

- AccuKnox platform access.

## Steps for Integration

### Step 1: Log in to AccuKnox

Log in to AccuKnox. Navigate to **Settings → Tokens** to create an AccuKnox token for forwarding scan results to SaaS. For details on generating tokens, refer to [How to Create Tokens](https://help.accuknox.com/how-to/how-to-create-tokens/?h=token "https://help.accuknox.com/how-to/how-to-create-tokens/?h=token").

### Step 2: Configure GitHub Secrets

Add the following secrets in your GitHub repository under **Settings > Secrets and Variables > Actions**:

| **Secret Name**      | **Description**                                      |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `ACCUKNOX_TOKEN`      | AccuKnox API token for authorization.                |
| `ACCUKNOX_ENDPOINT`   | The AccuKnox API URL (e.g., `cspm.demo.accuknox.com`).|
| `ACCUKNOX_LABEL`           | The label for your scan.ID.                             |


### Step 3: Set Up GitHub Actions Workflow

Create or update the `.github/workflows/dast-scan.yml` file in your repository with the following YAML configuration:

{% raw %}

```yaml
name: AccuKnox DAST Scan Workflow
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  dast-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Run AccuKnox DAST Scan
        uses: accuknox/dast-scan-action@latest
        with:
          target_url: "http://testphp.vulnweb.com"
          accuknox_endpoint: ${{ secrets.ACCUKNOX_ENDPOINT }}
          accuknox_token: ${{ secrets.ACCUKNOX_TOKEN }}
          accuknox_label: ${{ secrets.ACCUKNOX_LABEL }}
          severity_threshold: "High"
          scan_type: "baseline"
```

{% endraw %}

| `target_url`         | The web application URL to scan                                             | **Required**      | —              |
| `accuknox_token`     | Token to authenticate with the AccuKnox Console                             | **Required**      | —              |
| `accuknox_endpoint`  | URL of the AccuKnox Console to upload results                               | **Required**      | `cspm.demo.accuknox.com`            |
| `accuknox_label`     | Label to tag the scan results in the AccuKnox Console                       | **Required**      | —              |
| `severity_threshold` | Severity level (e.g., High, Medium, Low, Informational) to fail the pipeline | **Required**      | —              |
| `scan_type`          | Type of scan to perform (`baseline` or `full-scan`)                         | Optional          | `baseline`     |


!!! info "NOTE"
     You can customize this label by updating the value in the YAML file. For more details on creating and managing labels, refer to the [How to Create Labels](https://help.accuknox.com/how-to/how-to-create-labels/) documentation.

## Initial Workflow Without AccuKnox Scan

Initially, the CI/CD pipeline does not include the AccuKnox scan. When you push changes to the repository, no security checks are performed, potentially allowing security issues in the application.

## Workflow After AccuKnox Scan Integration

After integrating AccuKnox into your GitHub Actions workflow, the next push triggers the pipeline to run a DAST scan. The AccuKnox scan identifies potential vulnerabilities in the application.
