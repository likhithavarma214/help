title: GitLab Pipeline IaC Scan
description:  Integrate AccuKnox IaC scanning into GitLab pipelines to detect and fix misconfigurations, ensuring secure infrastructure deployment at scale.
---

This guide demonstrates how to integrate Infrastructure as Code (IaC) security into a GitLab CI/CD pipeline using AccuKnox. We will implement automated checks to identify configuration vulnerabilities in your IaC templates and send the results to AccuKnox for thorough analysis and remediation. This approach ensures your infrastructure is resilient and aligns with security best practices, effectively minimizing deployment risks.

## **Pre-requisites**

- GitLab Access

- AccuKnox Platform Access

## Steps for Integration

**Step 1**: Log in to AccuKnox. Navigate to **Settings → Tokens** to create an AccuKnox token for forwarding scan results to SaaS. For details on generating tokens, refer to [How to Create Tokens](https://help.accuknox.com/how-to/how-to-create-tokens/?h=token "https://help.accuknox.com/how-to/how-to-create-tokens/?h=token").

**Step 2:** Configure GitLab CI/CD Variables. For details on configuring variables, refer to [How to Create CI/CD Variables in GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/ "https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/").

1. **ACCUKNOX_TOKEN**: AccuKnox API token for authorization.

2. **ACCUKNOX_TENANT**: Your AccuKnox tenant ID.

3. **ACCUKNOX_ENDPOINT**: The AccuKnox API URL (e.g., [cspm.demo.accuknox.com](http://cspm.demo.accuknox.com/ "http://cspm.demo.accuknox.com")).

4. **ACCUKNOX_LABEL**: The label for your scan.

**Step 3**: Set Up GitLab CI/CD Pipeline

Create a new pipeline in your GitLab project with the following YAML configuration:

```yaml
include:
  - component: $CI_SERVER_FQDN/accu-knox/scan/iac-scan@1.0
    inputs:
      STAGE: test
      INPUT_DIRECTORY: "."
      INPUT_COMPACT: true
      INPUT_QUIET: true
      INPUT_SOFT_FAIL: false
      ACCUKNOX_TOKEN: ${ACCUKNOX_TOKEN}
      ACCUKNOX_TENANT: ${ACCUKNOX_TENANT}
      ACCUKNOX_ENDPOINT: ${ACCUKNOX_ENDPOINT}
      ACCUKNOX_LABEL: ${ACCUKNOX_LABEL}
```

## **Initial CI/CD Pipeline Without AccuKnox IaC Scan**

Initially, the CI/CD pipeline does not include the AccuKnox IaC scan. When changes are pushed to the repository, no infrastructure security checks are performed, potentially allowing misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in the IaC code.

## **CI/CD Pipeline After AccuKnox IaC Scan Integration**

Once the AccuKnox IaC scan is integrated into the CI/CD pipeline, every push triggers an IaC security scan. This scan identifies potential security vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in the infrastructure code, enhancing security before deployment. The findings are then sent to the AccuKnox platform.

## **View Results in AccuKnox SaaS**

**Step 1**: After the pipeline completes, navigate to the AccuKnox SaaS dashboard.

**Step 2**: Go to **Issues** > **Findings** and select **IaC Findings** to see identified vulnerabilities.

**Step 5**: After fixing the vulnerabilities, rerun the GitLab CI/CD pipeline and verify that the issues have been resolved in the AccuKnox dashboard.

## **Conclusion**

By integrating Checkov for IaC scanning with AccuKnox in a GitLab CI/CD pipeline, you strengthen the security of your infrastructure code. This integration allows for early detection and remediation of misconfigurations and vulnerabilities in the development lifecycle, ensuring a more secure deployment environment.
