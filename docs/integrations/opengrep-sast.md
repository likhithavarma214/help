# Integrating SAST with AccuKnox in GitHub Actions

This guide outlines integrating SAST scanning into a GitHub Actions workflow and forwarding the results to AccuKnox for analysis and mitigation.

### Prerequisites

- GitHub repository with Actions enabled

- AccuKnox SaaS account

### Integration Steps

#### Step 1: Generate AccuKnox API Token

Log in to AccuKnox. Navigate to **Settings → Tokens** to create an AccuKnox token to forward scan results to SaaS. For details on generating tokens, refer to [How to Create Tokens](https://help.accuknox.com/how-to/how-to-create-tokens/?h=token "https://help.accuknox.com/how-to/how-to-create-tokens/?h=token").

#### Step 2: Configure GitHub Secrets

Define the following secrets in GitHub, for details on configuring the secrets/variables, refer to [Using secrets in GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions "https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions").

- **ACCUKNOX_TOKEN**: AccuKnox API token for authorization.

- **ACCUKNOX_ENDPOINT**: The AccuKnox API URL (e.g., [cspm.demo.accuknox.com](http://cspm.demo.accuknox.com/ "http://cspm.demo.accuknox.com/")).

- **ACCUKNOX_LABEL**: The label for your scan.

#### Step 3: Define GitHub Actions Workflow

Create a new GitHub Actions workflow file `.github/workflows/accuknox-opengrep.yml` with the following configuration:

{% raw %}
```yaml
name: Accuknox SAST

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  accuknox-cicd:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: "Run Accuknox SAST: Opengrep"
        uses: accuknox/sast-scan-opengrep-action@latest
        with:
          accuknox_endpoint: ${{ secrets.ACCUKNOX_ENDPOINT }}
          accuknox_token: ${{ secrets.ACCUKNOX_TOKEN }}
          accuknox_label: ${{ secrets.ACCUKNOX_LABEL }}
          anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}}
          accuknox_ai_analysis: "false"
          soft_fail: "true"
```
{% endraw %}

| **soft_fail**   | Continue even if scan fails     | No           | `false`                  |


### Workflow Execution Without AccuKnox

Initially, Opengrep scans the code for vulnerabilities but does not forward results to AccuKnox, requiring manual review.

### Workflow Execution With AccuKnox

With AccuKnox integrated, Opengrep scan results are automatically sent to AccuKnox for further risk assessment and remediation.
