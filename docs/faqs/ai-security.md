??? "**3. How does AccuKnox differ from point AI security tools like guardrail-only platforms?**"
    Most AI security tools operate at only one layer — typically the LLM prompt interface. AccuKnox enforces security across every layer of the AI stack:
    + **Prompt layer**: Firewall inspects inputs and outputs for injection, jailbreaks, PII, and policy violations.
    + **Runtime layer**: eBPF/LSM-based KubeArmor enforcement at the kernel level controls process execution, file access, and network egress for AI workloads — something no prompt-only tool can do.
    + **Infrastructure layer**: CSPM and AI-DR detect misconfigurations, unauthorized deployments, and public exposure of model endpoints across cloud control planes.
    + **Identity layer**: KIEM maps AI agent entitlements, over-privileged roles, and lateral access paths across cloud and Kubernetes.
    + **Compliance layer**: Continuous evidence generation against 30+ frameworks — not a quarterly snapshot.

 
??? "**4. How does AccuKnox reduce false positives in AI security monitoring?**"
    AccuKnox uses contextual, AI-powered correlation to reduce false positives:
    + Policy types are decoupled — regex/keyword policies enforce strictly, while sensitive data classification policies use contextual analysis for improved accuracy.
    + Runtime behavioral baselines distinguish legitimate AI workload behavior from anomalies.
    + Alert correlation across prompt, model, API, and infrastructure layers filters noise before surfacing findings.
    + Users can tune policies per application use case, balancing precision against strict enforcement.
    AccuKnox's AI-powered correlation reduces false positives by up to 95% through intelligent analysis tuned for AI/LLM workload patterns.

## AI Asset Discovery & Shadow AI
 
??? "**5. How does AccuKnox discover AI assets across multi-cloud environments?**"
    AccuKnox performs continuous, agentless AI asset discovery across cloud accounts, Kubernetes clusters, and on-prem environments:
    + Onboarding a cloud account (AWS, Azure, GCP) triggers automatic inventory of all AI/ML assets — model endpoints, notebooks, MLOps pipelines, datasets, compute instances, and agent toolchains.
    + Discovery runs continuously, not as a point-in-time scan, so new assets are captured as soon as they are deployed.
    + All discovered assets are mapped into a unified security graph with lineage, ownership, and risk context.
    + Unowned, unregistered, or unsanctioned assets are flagged automatically for governance review.

 
??? "**6. How does AccuKnox provide visibility into Shadow AI?**"
    AccuKnox addresses Shadow AI through comprehensive auto-discovery and network telemetry:
    + Cloud account onboarding surfaces AI assets not registered in IAM logs or standard cloud inventories.
    + Network telemetry and outbound traffic analysis detect unauthorized API calls to external LLM services from enterprise endpoints.
    + Browser extension integration surfaces AI tool usage at the user and session level.
    + AI-SPM correlates usage with user identity and data access patterns to assess risk exposure.
    + Policy enforcement can block or alert on unapproved AI services in real time.
    Shadow AI adds an average of $670K in extra breach costs per IBM's 2025 Data Breach Report. AccuKnox closes this visibility gap before it becomes a liability.

## AI-DR: Detection and Response
 
??? "**8. What is AccuKnox AI-DR and how does it work?**"
    AccuKnox AI-DR (AI Detection and Response) is a cloud-native detection and response module purpose-built for AI workloads. It correlates signals across cloud control planes, runtime environments, and prompt interactions to detect and respond to AI-specific threats:
    + **Cloud Control Plane Monitoring**: Continuously ingests AWS CloudTrail, Azure Logs, and GCP Logs to detect unauthorized AI deployments, public exposure of model endpoints, and usage in non-approved regions.
    + **Cross-Layer Correlation**: Links signals from prompts, models, APIs, and infrastructure to reconstruct full attack paths — for example, prompt injection leading to data exfiltration through an agent tool call.
    + **Automated Response**: Triggers CDR policies and GitOps workflows to restrict access, make exposed assets private, block risky models, or enforce region-specific deployment rules in real time.
    + **Runtime Behavioral Analysis**: Detects anomalous agent behavior, unexpected outbound connections, privilege escalation, and unauthorized data access at the workload level.
 
    **References:**
    - [AI-DR Use Case](https://help.accuknox.com/use-cases/aidr/)
 
??? "**9. Can AccuKnox AI-DR automatically respond to AI security incidents?**"
    Yes. AccuKnox AI-DR supports automated response through CDR policies and GitOps workflows:
    + Restrict access to over-exposed model endpoints or sensitive AI datasets.
    + Make publicly exposed AI assets private automatically upon detection.
    + Block deployment of risky or non-approved models.
    + Enforce region-specific deployment policies for compliance with data residency requirements.
    + Trigger alerts, create tickets in Jira or ServiceNow, and notify via Slack or PagerDuty with full incident context.
    Response actions are configurable per policy — monitor, alert, or enforce — giving teams control over automation thresholds.
 
    **References:**
    - [AI-DR Use Case](https://help.accuknox.com/use-cases/aidr/)
 
??? "**10. Could AccuKnox have detected a multi-layer AI attack chain like the McKinsey chatbot incident?**"
    Yes. AccuKnox provides end-to-end AI attack surface visibility across prompts, models, APIs, and infrastructure simultaneously:
    + Correlates signals from prompt inputs, model behavior, API calls, and runtime anomalies to detect chained attack sequences.
    + Uses policy enforcement to flag prompt injection, data exfiltration, and misuse patterns across layers.
    + Supports cross-layer correlation (AI-SPM + runtime + API security) to reconstruct multi-stage attack paths.
    + Automated red teaming proactively tests for attack chains before they are exploited in production.
    In the ZombieAgent attack pattern demonstrated by Radware, AccuKnox's runtime enforcement would block the unauthorized binary execution triggered by the hidden instruction — even when the prompt-layer detection is bypassed.

## Prompt Firewall & Data Protection
 
??? "**11. How does AccuKnox Prompt Firewall protect LLM applications?**"
    The AccuKnox Prompt Firewall is a dual-layer policy enforcement engine that inspects both prompt inputs and model responses in real time:
    + **Input Policies**: Detect and block direct prompt injection, indirect prompt injection, jailbreak attempts, PII/PHI in prompts, embedded credentials, API keys, and harmful content.
    + **Response Policies**: Inspect model outputs for data leakage, hallucination patterns, policy violations, and regulated content before they reach the end user.
    + **12+ Policy Categories**: Including toxicity, competitor mentions, regulatory violations, custom business logic, and sensitive data classification.
    + **Zero Trust Alignment**: Enforces deny-by-default policy posture for LLM interactions — only explicitly allowed content passes through.
    + **Configurable Actions**: Per-policy actions include monitor, alert, redact, or block, giving teams granular control.
    The firewall integrates with applications via SDK or API proxy, adding minimal latency overhead while providing kernel-backed enforcement for workloads running in Kubernetes.
 
    **References:**
    - [Prompt Firewall Use Case](https://help.accuknox.com/use-cases/prompt-firewall/)
 
??? "**12. Does AccuKnox detect and block sensitive data in prompts — PII, API keys, credentials?**"
    Yes. AccuKnox detects PII, PHI, API keys, credentials, and other sensitive data in both prompts sent to LLMs and responses received from them:
    + Covers data in transit to external and internal LLMs as well as generated outputs.
    + Uses pattern matching combined with contextual classification for improved accuracy over static keyword rules.
    + Configurable actions per data type: monitor, alert, redact inline, or block the request entirely.
    + Dataset-level PII/PHI scanning extends protection to training data and vector embeddings stored in cloud environments.
    + Helps prevent data leakage, compliance violations, and accidental exposure of regulated information in real time.
 
    **References:**
    - [LLM Static Scan](https://help.accuknox.com/how-to/llm-static-scan/)
    - [ML Static Scan](https://help.accuknox.com/how-to/ml-static-scan/)
 
??? "**13. How does AccuKnox handle false positives in prompt enforcement — for example, a blocked keyword used in a valid context?**"
    AccuKnox supports distinct policy types to manage this precisely:
    + **Strict keyword/regex policies** enforce blocking regardless of context — appropriate for high-risk categories like credentials and PII.
    + **Contextual sensitive data classification policies** use semantic analysis to evaluate intent and context, reducing false positives for ambiguous cases.
    + Users can configure which policy type applies per use case, balancing precision against strict enforcement requirements.
    + Policy decoupling means changes to one rule do not affect others — reducing operational risk when tuning.
    + Audit logs capture every decision with full context, enabling teams to review and refine policies based on real traffic patterns.

## Agentic AI Security
 
??? "**14. How does AccuKnox secure AI Agents at runtime?**"
    AccuKnox secures AI agents through multi-layer runtime sandboxing and policy enforcement:
    + **Local Process Isolation**: Linux Security Modules (LSMs) enforce security policies at the kernel level — controlling process behavior, file access, network connections, and execution permissions for agents running on the host OS. Extremely low overhead, suitable for production environments.
    + **Remote Container Isolation**: For higher-risk scenarios, AccuKnox routes LLM-generated code or external tool execution to a dedicated, isolated container or remote execution service, preventing malicious code from affecting the host.
    + **Tool-Call Enforcement**: Every tool or API call initiated by an agent is evaluated against least-privilege policies before execution. Unauthorized tool usage is blocked inline.
    + **Untrusted Code Sandboxing**: Auto-generated or externally sourced code is executed in a secure sandbox — mitigating RCE, privilege escalation, and resource overload risks.
    + **Behavioral Monitoring**: Continuous telemetry feeds anomaly detection engines that flag deviations from baseline agent behavior, enabling forensic analysis and incident response.

    + MCP servers operate within a sandboxed execution environment with strict process and network isolation enforced at the kernel level.
    + All interactions with the MCP server are governed by authorization controls — only approved callers with verified identity can invoke MCP tool functions.
    + Continuous monitoring tracks every tool call, data access, and external communication initiated through the MCP server.
    + AccuKnox maps MCP tool risks by category: access to private data, exposure to untrusted content, and ability to communicate externally.
    + Attack simulation validates MCP server defenses against known attack patterns including tool poisoning and indirect prompt injection via MCP tool descriptions.
 
??? "**16. How does AccuKnox bring visibility and governance to internally built AI agents?**"
    AccuKnox provides end-to-end governance for internally developed agents across the full agent lifecycle:
    + **Discovery**: Automatically inventories all internally developed agents, models, and pipelines across cloud and on-prem environments — including assets not registered in IAM or cloud inventories.
    + **Mapping**: Maps agent capabilities, data access scope, tool integrations, and external API dependencies for complete contextual visibility.
    + **Governance**: Applies policy-as-code controls at build, deploy, and runtime stages.
    + **Monitoring**: Continuously tracks agent behavior, drift from baseline, and anomalous actions.
    + **Audit**: Maintains AIBOM-based lineage and audit trails for every agent action, providing evidence for compliance and incident investigations.
